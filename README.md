# Ordered Dithering

This repository contains a C++ program for performing ordered dithering on an image, resulting in a new file that contains the resulting image in black and white colors (as small dots). Ordered dithering is a technique used in image processing to reduce the number of colors in an image while maintaining visual quality by simulating additional colors through dither patterns.

## Features

- Load an image file.
- Perform ordered dithering on the image.
- A new file will be generated, which containing the resulting image in black and white colors.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure you have the following:

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with this program:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ordered-Dithering.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

3. Build and compile the code using your C++ compiler.

4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Usage

1. Launch the program after compiling it.

2. Load an image file by providing the file path or browsing and selecting the image file.

3. Initiate the ordered dithering process by clicking on the Run button.

4. The program will perform ordered dithering on the image, converting it into black and white colors.

5. A new file will be generated, containing the resulting image in black and white colors.

6. You can view and analyze the resulting image using an image viewer or editor.
